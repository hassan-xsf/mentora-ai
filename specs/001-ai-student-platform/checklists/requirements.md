# Specification Quality Checklist: AI Student Platform

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-05-25
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items pass. The spec covers all 5 PRD features as independently
testable user stories (P1–P3). Assumptions section documents 6 deferred
decisions (assessment question set, XP thresholds, roadmap template library,
study-hour heuristic, coding editor scope, v1 auth scope) — these are to be
resolved during `/sp.plan`.

Ready to proceed to `/sp.plan 001-ai-student-platform`.
